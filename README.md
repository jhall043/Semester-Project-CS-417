## Project Overview
This project processes CPU core temperature data from a file, providing:
- **Piecewise Linear Interpolation**: Estimates temperatures between time steps.
- **Global Linear Least Squares Approximation**: Fits a linear model (y = mx + b) to each core's data using a pre-solved A|bâƒ— method and predicts temperatures.
